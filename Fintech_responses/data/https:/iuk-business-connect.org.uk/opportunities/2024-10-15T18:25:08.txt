{"value":0.5,"confidence_level":0.7,"summary_reason":"The provided Innovate UK grant scheme information includes multiple opportunities for business growth, collaboration, and funding, which are relevant to the Fintech field. However, specific mentions of Fintech-related grants are not evident, which limits the direct relevance. Despite this, the broad categories such as digital innovation and investment opportunities indicate a moderate level of support. My confidence is moderate due to the lack of specific Fintech grants but the presence of applicable broader opportunities."}
