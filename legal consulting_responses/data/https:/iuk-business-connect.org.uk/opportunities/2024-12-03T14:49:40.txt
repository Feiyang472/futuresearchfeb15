{"value":-0.5,"confidence_level":0.8,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme appears to have limited direct relevance to the legal consulting field, with no specific grants or opportunities tailored to this sector. While there are some general opportunities and support for business growth, they are not specifically focused on legal consulting. My confidence is moderate to high given the lack of targeted opportunities and the broad nature of the grants."}
