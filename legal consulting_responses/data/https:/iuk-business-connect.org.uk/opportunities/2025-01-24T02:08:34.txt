{"value":-0.5,"confidence_level":0.6,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme does not explicitly mention legal consulting as a specific sector or opportunity category in the provided information. While there are broader categories like 'Business Growth' and 'Innovation' that might tangentially support a legal consulting start-up, the absence of direct, targeted grants for the legal field indicates a lack of strong support. Therefore, it receives a score of -0.5, with moderate confidence due to the possibility of indirect applicability through related sectors."}
