{"value":0.2,"confidence_level":0.6,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme provides numerous opportunities across a wide range of sectors like AI, digital, and manufacturing, but there are no specific mentions or targeted funding opportunities for the legal consulting field. While some opportunities could tangentially benefit legal consulting startups, such as those related to digital or AI, the lack of direct relevance reduces the overall supportiveness for this specific field. My confidence is moderate due to the broad nature of the grant descriptions and potential indirect applicability."}
