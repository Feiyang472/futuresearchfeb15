{"value":0.5,"confidence_level":0.8,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme provides a wide array of funding opportunities across various sectors, including AI, digital innovation, and business growth, which could be relevant to a legal consulting start-up focusing on technological integration or innovation. However, the direct mention of legal consulting as a specific field for grants is lacking, hence the moderate score. My confidence is relatively high given the broad applicability of the grants, yet slightly reduced by the lack of explicit legal-focused opportunities."}
