{"value":0.2,"confidence_level":0.7,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme does not specifically list 'legal consulting' as a sector. However, there are multiple opportunities under broader categories such as 'Business growth', 'Collaboration', and 'Commercial opportunity' that could indirectly benefit legal consulting startups. While the scheme is extensive, the direct applicability to legal consulting is limited, hence a slightly positive but low score."}
