{"value":0.5,"confidence_level":0.7,"summary_reason":"The Innovate UK grant scheme includes several relevant opportunities for the health sector, which can be related to cancer research. While there are no direct mentions of cancer-specific grants, the presence of health and biotechnology-related funding opportunities suggests some level of support. However, without explicit cancer-focused grants, the support is moderate, leading to a score of 0.5."}
